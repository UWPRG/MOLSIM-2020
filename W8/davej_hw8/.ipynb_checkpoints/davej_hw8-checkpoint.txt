1. Took the snapshot, looked pretty cool. For some reason I could NOT figure out how to distinguish the colors between the ions and the protein carbons... idk what that's about

2. For sure an alpha helix. That is so cool! 

3. The first peak must correspond to all of the oxygen-hydrogen covalent bonds, and not the first hydration shell.
