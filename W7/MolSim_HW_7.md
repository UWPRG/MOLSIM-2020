## MolSim HW 7: Scaling Analysis

The following table contains the results of my scaling analysis.

The set of scaling parameters that makes the most sense depends mainly on your own simulation goals. In this set of simulations, I would say the best simulation number is 15 because you maximize the number of nanoseconds per day and are still capable of running the largest number of walkers on only two nodes.
